			</header>
			<p>After that we had passed a great part of our journey, we came to a village where we lay all night, but hearken, and I will tell you what mischief happened there: you shall understand there was a servant to whom his master had committed the whole government of his house, and was master of the lodging where we lay: this servant had married a maiden of the same house, howbeit he was greatly in love with a harlot of the town, and accustomed to resort unto her, wherewith his wife was so highly displeased and became so jealous, that she gathered together all her husbandâ€™s substance, with his tales and books of account, and threw them into a light fire: she was not contented with this, but she took a cord and bound her child which she had by her husband, about her middle and cast herself headlong into a deep pit. The master taking in evil part the death of these twain, took his servant which was the cause of this murder by his luxury, and first after that he had put off all his apparel, he anointed his body with honey, and then bound him sure to a fig tree, where in a rotten stock a great number of pismires had builded their nests, the pismires after they had felt the sweetness of the honey came upon his body, and by little and little (in continuance of time) devoured all his flesh, in such sort, that there remained on the tree but his bare bones: this was declared unto us by the inhabitants of the village there, who greatly sorrowed for the death of this servant: then we avoiding likewise from this dreadful lodging incontinently departed away.</p>
