			<p>What and who he was attend a while, and you shall understand that it was even I, the writer of mine own <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Metamorphosie</i> and strange alteration of figure. Hymettus, Athens, Isthmia, Ephire, Tenaros, and Sparta, being fat and fertile soils (as I pray you give credit to the books of more everlasting fame) be places where mine ancient progeny and lineage did sometime flourish: there I say, in Athens, when I was young, I went first to school. Soon after (as a stranger) I arrived at Rome, whereas by great industry, and without instruction of any schoolmaster, I attained to the full perfection of the Latin tongue. Behold, I first crave and beg your pardon, lest I should happen to displease or offend any of you by the rude and rustic utterance of this strange and foreign language. And verily this new alteration of speech doth correspond to the enterprised matter whereof I purpose to entreat, I will set forth unto you a pleasant Grecian feast. Whereunto gentle reader if thou wilt give attendant ear, it will minister unto thee such delectable matter as thou shalt be contented withal.</p>
