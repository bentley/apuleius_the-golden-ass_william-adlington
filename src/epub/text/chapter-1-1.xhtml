					<p epub:type="bridgehead">How Apuleius riding in Thessaly, fortuned to fall into company with two strangers, that reasoned together of the mighty power of Witches.</p>
				</header>
				<p>As I fortuned to take my voyage into Thessaly, about certain affairs which I had to do (for there mine ancestry by my mother’s side inhabiteth, descended of the line of that most excellent person Plutarch, and of Sextus the Philosopher his Nephew, which is to us a great honour) and after that by much travel and great pain I had passed over the high mountains and slippery valleys, and had ridden through the cloggy fallowed fields; perceiving that my horse did wax somewhat slow, and to the intent likewise that I might repose and strengthen myself (being weary with riding) I lighted off my horse, and wiping the sweat from every part of his body, I unbrideled him, and walked him softly in my hand, to the end he might pisse, and ease himself of his weariness and travel: and while he went grazing freshly in the field (casting his head sometimes aside, as a token of rejoicing and gladness) I perceived a little before me two companions riding, and so I overtaking them made a third. And while I listened to hear their communication, the one of them laughed and mocked his fellow, saying, Leave off I pray thee and speak no more, for I cannot abide to hear thee tell such absurd and incredible lies; which when I heard, I desired to hear some news, and said, I pray you masters make me partaker of your talk, that am not so curious as desirous to know all your communication: so shall we shorten our journey, and easily pass this high hill before us, by merry and pleasant talk.</p>
				<p>But he that laughed before at his fellow, said again, Verily this tale is as true, as if a man would say that by sorcery and enchantment the floods might be enforced to run against their course, the seas to be immovable, the air to lack the blowing of winds, the Sun to be restrained from his natural race, the Moon to purge his skim upon herbs and trees to serve for sorceries: the stars to be pulled from heaven, the day to be darkened and the dark night to continue still. Then I being more desirous to hear his talk than his companions, said, I pray you, that began to tell your tale even now, leave not off so, but tell the residue. And turning to the other I said, You perhaps that are of an obstinate mind and gross ears, mock and condemn those things which are reported for truth, know you not that it is accounted untrue by the depraved opinion of men, which either is rarely seen, seldom heard, or passeth the capacity capacity
 of man’s reason, which if it be more narrowly scanned, you shall not only find it evident and plain, but also very easy to be brought to pass.</p>
