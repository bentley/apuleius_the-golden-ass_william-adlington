					<p epub:type="bridgehead">How Apuleius was found by his shadow.</p>
				</header>
				<p>As we passed by the way we met with a tall souldier (for so his habite and countenance declared) who with proud and arrogant words spake to my master in this sort:</p>
				<p>
					<i xml:lang="la">Quorsum vacuum ducis Asinum?</i>
				</p>
				<p>My master somewhat astonied at the strange sights which he saw before, and ignorant of the Latin tongue, roade on and spake never a word: The souldier unable to refraine his insolence, and offended at his silence, strake him on the shoulders as he sat on my back; then my master gently made answer that he understood not what he said, whereat the souldier angerly demanded again, whither he roade with his Asse? Marry (quoth he) to the next City: But I (quoth the souldier) have need of his helpe, to carry the trusses of our Captaine from yonder Castle, and therewithall he took me by the halter and would violently have taken me away: but my master wiping away the blood of the blow which he received of the souldier, desired him gently and civilly to take some pity upon him, and to let him depart with his own, swearing and affirming that his slow Asse, welnigh dead with sicknesse, could scarce carry a few handfuls of hearbs to the next town, much less he was able to beare any greater trusses: but when he saw the souldier would in no wise be intreated, but ready with his staffe to cleave my masters head, my master fell down at his feete, under colour to move him to some pity, but when he saw his time, he took the souldier by the legs and cast him upon the ground: Then he buffetted him, thumped him, bit him, and took a stone and beat his face and his sides, that he could not turne and defend himself, but onely threaten that if ever he rose, he would choppe him in pieces. The Gardener when he heard him say so, drew out his javelin which he had by his side, and when he had thrown it away, he knockt and beate him more cruelly then he did before, insomuch that the souldier could not tell by what means to save himself, but by feining that he was dead, Then my master took the javelin and mounted upon my back, riding in all hast to the next village, having no regard to go to his Garden, and when he came thither, he turned into one of his friends house and declared all the whole matter, desiring him to save his life and to hide himself and his Asse in some secret place, untill such time as all danger were past. Then his friends not forgetting the ancient amity betweene them, entertained him willingly and drew me up a pair of stairs into a chamber, my master crept into a chest, and lay there with the cover closed fast: The souldier (as I afterwards learned) rose up as one awaked from a drunken sleepe, but he could scarce go by reason of his wounds: howbeit at length by little and little through aid of his staffe he came to the town, but he would not declare the matter to any person nor complaine to any justice, lest he should be accused of cowardise or dastardnesse, yet in the end he told some of his companions of all the matter that happened: then they took him and caused him to be closed in some secret place, thinking that beside the injury which he had received, he should be accused of the breach of his faith, by reason of the losse of his spear, and when they had learned the signes of my master, they went to search him out: at last there was an unfaithfull neighbour that told them where he was, then incontinently the souldiers went to the Justice declaring that they had lost by the way a silver goblet of their Captaines, and that a Gardener had found it, who refusing to deliver the goblet, was hidden in one of his friends houses: by and by the Magistrates understanding the losse of the Captaine, came to the doors where we were, commanded our host to deliver my master upon paine of death: howbeit these threatnings could not enforce him to confess that he was within his doors, but by reason of his faithfull promise and for the safeguard of his friend, he said, that he saw not the Gardener a great while, neither knew where he was: the souldiers said contrary, whereby to know the verity of the matter, the Magistrates commanded their Seargants and ministers to search every corner of the house, but when they could find neither Gardener nor Asse, there was a great contention betweene the souldiers and our Host, for they said we were within the house: and he said no, but I that was very curious to know the matter, when I heard so great a noise, put my head out of the window to learne what the stirre and tumult did signifie. It fortuned that one of the souldiers perceived my shadow, whereupon he began to cry, saying: that he had certainly seene me; then they were all glad and came up into the chamber, and pulled me down like a prisoner. When they had found me, they doubted nothing of the Gardener, but seeking about more narrowly, at length they found him couched in a chest. And so they brought out the poore gardener to the Justices, who was committed immediately to prison, but they could never forbeare laughing from the time they found me by my shadow, wherefore is risen a common Proverbe: “The shadow of the Asse.”</p>
