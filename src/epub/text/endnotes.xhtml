					<p>1 That the hero transformed to an ass was the motive of two Greek romances can hardly be doubted after Photius’ statement. The one, he says, was the work of Lucius of Patrae (who wrote (jieTa./ju p f (I)ffeuv \6-yoiis 5ia opow), the other the work of Lucian. The Aowctoj <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span>) ‘Ovos, preserved in the works of Lucian, is doubtless one of the romances known to Photius. But its style and impartiality never for an instant suggest Lucian, who would have made the metamorphosis a peg for satire. And modern scholars are for the most part agreed that Lucian was not the author. Other considerations prevent our assigning it to Lucius, who, it is said, ran to a greater length, and it would be difficult to set forth the story in briefer terms than are employed by the author of AOWCIOJ T) ‘Ovot. Probably it is the work of neither, though it may well be the romance attributed to Lucian by Photius. The only sure fact is that in the Aotxios r) ‘Ooy are to be found the dry bones of The Golden Ass. The curious may consult Professor Rohde’s Ueber Luciarfs Schrift Aotf/rtoj -<span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span>) ‘O^os und ihr Verhaeltniss zu Lucius von Patrae und den Metamorphosen des Apuleius.</p>
